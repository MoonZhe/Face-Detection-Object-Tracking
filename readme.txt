There are two python files in here.
face_detection.py is the one with just face detection and the other
ones face_colourdetection.py is the code with face detection and colour tracking 
combined. To use the face_colourdetection, when run, it will ask for the colour u want to 
track. Enter 1 into the python console for red colour, 2 for blue, 3 for green, 4 for orange, 5 for yellow.
Additionally, it will rapidly take 5 snapshot of detected face and the photos will be
